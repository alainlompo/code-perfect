<h3>Java code optimization cons and pros</h3>
<h4>Java code optimization cons</h4>
<br/>
Here are a few reasons why we should be very cautious about Java code optimization

<ul>
	<li>
		Significant risks of regression
	</li>
	<li>
		Code clarity and simplicity reduction
	</li>
	<li>
		Risk of loosing the platform - independance feature (when using native methods in order to optimize)
	</li>
	<li>Risk of reducing the extensibility of the code </li>
	<li>If the used optimization techniques are platform dependent, it may result in performance degradation instead of optimization on a different platform</li>
	
</ul>
